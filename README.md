# Collibra Mock Business Glossary

This is a beginner-friendly mock project that simulates the structure and concepts of a **Business Glossary** and **Data Dictionary** inspired by Collibra's approach to metadata management.

##  Purpose

To demonstrate a foundational understanding of data governance principles and metadata documentation using simplified examples. This project is part of my data analytics and data governance portfolio.

##  Project Structure

- `glossary/`: Contains mock business terms and definitions as a CSV file
- `metadata_model/`: Describes relationships between data assets, terms, and domains
- `assets/`: Placeholder for supporting diagrams or visuals
- `.gitignore`: Standard Git ignore rules

##  Concepts Demonstrated

- Business Glossary vs. Data Dictionary
- Metadata types (technical, business)
- Domain and stewardship relationships
- Data governance best practices
- Glossary ownership and approvals (simulated)

##  Sample Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `glossary_sample.csv` | A simple glossary of business terms with definitions |
| `business_terms_model.md` | Describes glossary structure and role relationships |

##  Tools Used

- Git & GitHub (for version control)
- Markdown & CSV
- Visualisation (optional): draw.io / Lucidchart for diagrams

##  Future Enhancements

- Add sample workflows to simulate stewardship
- Integrate with mock data lineage diagrams
- Compare with Collibra UI structure

> This project is educational and intended to demonstrate metadata documentation skills in a tool-agnostic manner.
